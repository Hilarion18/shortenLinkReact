> Short blurb about what our product does.

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

This project created to shorten link, integrated with bit.ly API

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `1. server folder`
here in server side, go to server folder
  ```sh
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
"npm install" and run "npm run dev" to run your localhost server

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `2. short-link folder`
here in client side, go to short-link folder
 
  ```sh
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

"npm install" and run "npm start" to run your client, you will go directly to default browser to open the client

your port `3000` will be already in use for server so you will see on the terminal<br/>
`Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n)`

just type y and enter
usually your browser will use port `3001`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
