### `2. short-link folder`
here in client side, go to short-link folder
 
  ```sh
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

"npm install" and run "npm start" to run your client, you will go directly to default browser to open the client

your port `3000` will be already in use for server so you will see on the terminal<br/>
`Would you like to run the app on another port instead? (Y/n)`

just type y and enter
usually your browser will use port `3001`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
